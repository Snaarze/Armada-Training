<!-- the stopPropagation is to stop or prevent anymore events to happen. it will only trigger the event where the event happens! if that makes sense-->
<!-- another reason is that since we attached the listeners to the parent and we click a child on it the events will run through until it reaches that parent -->
<!-- it is useful to use stopPropagation when adding or attaching listeners to the parent of it, so it can prevent unnecessary  events that will happen-->
